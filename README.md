# udacity_data_analysis_project


The fictional client here is a beginner tech school that offers MOOCs, but they don't have a strong brand presence yet, nor do they have a high percentage of loyal customers.

The business objective of this project is to drive well informed recommendations to help the client **improve the project converstion rate** within the courses they provide.

To address this problem, I will conduct a thorough data analysis to identify insights and trends based on engagement students data avaliable.

**THE FULL DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS TAKEN IN THE PROJECT:** 

Question phase > Wrangle > Explore > Draw Conclusions > Communicate
